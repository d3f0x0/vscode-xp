# Getting started

You can install the extension very quickly from the VSCode marketplace:
![Installing extension](./ru_gif/install_extension.gif)

To simplify the creation of rules, the most popular templates are used:
![Creating rules from templates](./ru_gif/create_rules_from_templates.gif)

The extension provides auto-completion of taxonomy fields, keywords, functions with their descriptions. Snippets (template pieces of code) are also available to speed up and simplify the addition of XP language constructs:
![Autocomplete and snippets](./ru_gif/hover_autocomplete_snippets.gif)

Testing a rule is the key to its stable and accurate operation without false positives. This is how you need to work with integration tests for correlations and enrichments:
![Integration tests](./ru_gif/integration_tests.gif)

This is how you need to create integration tests:
![Adding an integration test](./ru_gif/integration_test_addition.gif)

Check the localization of rules, as well as test entire directories with rules:
![Localization testing and mass testing of rules](./ru_gif/localization_test_and_test_folder.gif)

If you collect events from Windows logs, you can convert them to the desired format as follows:
![Adding Windows events to tests](./ru_gif/xml_to_json.gif)

Validation of displayed rules (testing of code and localizations, correctness of the rule structure):
![Validation of rules](./en_gif/content_validation.gif)

If you want to correlate EVTX files using selected content:
![Correlation of EVTX files](./ru_gif/evtx_correlator.gif)

You can create a table list in a very simple way:
![Creating a table list](./ru_gif/create_table.gif)

To load the resulting content into the product, you must export to a KB file:
![Export KB file](./ru_gif/export_kb.gif)
